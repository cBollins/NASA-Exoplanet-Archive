# NASA Exoplanet Archive EDA

An EDA exploring the properties of confirmed exoplanets using publicly available data from NASA's archive:

> https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/

A full walkthrough of the project is given in "Project_Tour.ipynb", including how the TAS query API works within each exercise folder. 

## Exercise 1

The first exercise is simply recreating some of the plots seen on the first webpage when you follow the link above:
1. Exolanet mass vs. orbital period
2. Cumulative exoplanet discovery frequency by year
3. Eccentricity vs. orbital period
4. Planet density vs. planet radius

## Kepler Candidates

This section looks at the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) database. After exploring the implications of various `NaN` elements, the data was cleaned and split into `X, y`. The idea is to try and predict the `koi_disposition`, or whether the readings of the exoplanet candidate indicate a "FALSE POSITIVE" or "CONFIRMED" exoplanet.
